### **Problem**

I'm so glad we've got you on the team; I don't think we'd have managed to get that last one if it weren't for you. We've been watching the account, and the target just posted another image. This guy really doesn't learn. We don't think he's left Spain yet, but we really need this one pinpointed exactly. Can you work where he took this?

The map here should be accurate to 50 meters.

### **Solution**

It says the picture is in Spain, so I just did a quick image search for "blue eyed tree man sculpture spain" and one of the first results looked almost identical. That told us that this was located at Park PortAventura which is a resort in Tarragona Spain. we had to be within 50 meters on this one, so we go to the map to see if we can figure it out. There appears to be water behind him, and if we look at the map it looks like there is a lake in the middle of the resort it also looks like he is sitting on a wooden platform of some kind, There is one place on the west bank of the river that looks like it is probably a wooden platform. I put the pin there and it was accepted as the flag.
