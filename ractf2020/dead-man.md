#### **Problem**

Aargh! They gave us the slip again. We got another image from their Twitter, but it doesn't look like they're in the same country anymore. Are you able to track them down again for us and tell us the town they're in? You're our best man at this point, so we're expecting great things.

Our map here should be accurate to 500 meters.

#### **Solution**

As with all of theses there are many ways to go about this. I decided to use the title of this challenge as a direction and see if I could get any information off of a gravestone. The one in the closest row is a little bit blurry, but I was able to make out `A Longmuir`. I went over to [Billion Graves](https://billiongraves.com/) , a site that lets you search by name for peoples graves and locations and put in "A Longmuir" and the first [result](https://billiongraves.com/grave/A-Longmuir/5903477) appears to match what we see in our picture. This tell us that this is the **Kanchanaburi War Cemetery**. We look that up on the map. and can use that monument in the middle as a guide for the general location. I placed the pin on the map and it was correct.
