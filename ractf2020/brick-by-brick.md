#### **Solution**

The first thing that caught my attention that might help us figure this out is the flags on the tower. I did a search for "red and yellow stripe flag" and quickly found that the flag is the [Estelada](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estelada) which is flag flown by independence supporters in the Catalonia region of Spain. This means we are looking for a castle of some sort in Catalonia Spain. I did a search for "famous castles catalonia" and found a travel site that listed several. I scrolled through the list and found that `Castillo de Besalu` looked a lot like the one in our pictures. I zoomed in to that general location on the map and placed the poing and it was correct.
