#### **Problem**

Amazing work with that last image! We dispatched a team right away, but it seems our target was one step ahead of us. We're not sure what they're planning, but we managed to download one final image off the Instagram account until they locked it down.

Can you work out where this picture was taken? One of the guys thought it might have been Queensferry crossing, but that doesn't look right. You'll have to be accurate to within 2 kilometers

#### **Solution**

The first thing I did was look into the Queensferry crossing bridge as that was mentioned in the clue. From that I learned that this style of bridge is called a cable-stayed bridge. The bridge in the foreground in the same type. I also noted that it seems to have yellow tops as well as a yellow on the sides. With a quick google photo search I found one with the same design that was the Ting Kau Bridge in Hong Kong. I found it on a map and the other 2 visible bridges were also there, so this was the place we needed. I placed the pin on the map in the general are of where the picture would have been taken and it was correct.
